# APC-randomness

## True randomness and how to get it

Random number generation is a tough if not impossible thing to do. That’s why we have the best next thing, pseudorandom number generators. You’ll learn why the C library rand() is not random at all and what alternatives there are. You’ll investigate the properties of different pseudorandom numbers generating algorithms, find out what cryptographically-strong PRNGs are and be able to show really cool looking graphs for others to admire! And of course you’ll add a couple of new terms to your vocabulary like Mersenne Twister or permuted congruential generator that are guaranteed to impress just about everybody during a family dinner.
